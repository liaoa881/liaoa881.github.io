    <h1>AND THAT LANGUAGE</h1>
    <h2>By: Lawrence Joseph</h2>

    <div class ="container">
        <p>
            And that language that parts the future from the past
            <br>
            the poet slips into, <span id="number"></span> people the same pulse
            <br>
            the sounds around the poem—was it <span id="month"></span>?—
            <br>
            saxophone and mandolin sounds on the radio,
            <br>
            a grammar of trees in the wind in the leaves
            <br>
            in ecstasies of grace, this company of <span id="power"></span>—
            <br>
            you, at first sight; you—a language,
            <br>
            the <span id="texture"></span> touch a language; beauty's
            <br>
            eyes, your eyes, unclose me anywhere I am.
        </p>
