            <h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>
            <p>Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by 
                Pendleton Ward and co-produced by Frederator Studios for Cartoon Network. The story follows a
                young human boy named Finn and a magical dog named Jake in the Land of Ooo. They are faced with challenges to protect the
                citizens with Princess Bubblegum and fight against villians such as the Ice King, Vampire King, and the Lich.

            <h2>The Easter Egg</h2>
            <p> In every episode of Adventure Time, except the pilot episode, "Food Chain", "The Wand", "BMO", "Obsidian", and the Frog Seasons short, 
                a hidden snail appears to wave at the audience. In the episode "Mortal Folly" S2 EP25, the directors used this easter egg as a way
                for the villain to escape through possession. Eventually, the snail becomes more involved into the story, having dialogue and plot-driving actions.
