            <h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>
            <p>A Hidden Mickey is a representation of the beloved character, Mickey Mouse, which have been placed subtly in various attrations within Disney 
                theme parks, tv shows, and also feature-length movie series. The Hidden Mickey is commonly depicted as three circles that form the sillouette
                of Mickey Mouse's head - also known as Classic Mickey by Disney aficionados.

            <h2>The Easter Egg</h2>
            <p> Hidden Mickeys are placed all around Disney products and attractions. Typically, these patterns could be painted, made of various objects, or also be worn
                within certain paintings. The first easter egg was discovered by Arlen Miller who wrote the article on Hidden Mickeys in 1989. These original designs
                were first made during the designing of the EPCOT center to be more for adults, selling alcohol and such and preventing the use of disney characters
                as the company thought it would be improper to combine alcohol and their characters. Imagineers took this as a challenge and hid various patterns throughout the building,
