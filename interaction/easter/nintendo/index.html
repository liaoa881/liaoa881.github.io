            <h2>WHAT IS IT</h2>
            <p>On March 3, 2017, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller was released to the public. It contains
                all the necessary joysticks and buttons need for various games, simialrly to Xbox and Playstation
                controllers. It holds a transparent cover with special features such as motion controls, HD rumble,
                built-in amiibo scanner and etc.

            </p>

            <h2>The Easter Egg</h2>
            <p> Within the motherboard of the controller, there is an engraving of stating the words "THX2ALLGAMEFANS!". To see it,
                hold the right downwards and look through the plastic socket using a light source. This easter egg was first
                discovered by a Japanese Twitter user, Geo Stream, on March 4, 2017, one day after the controller's launch.
