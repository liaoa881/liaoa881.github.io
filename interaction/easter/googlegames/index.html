            <h2>The Easter Egg</h2>
            <p> Since the 2000s, Google has constantly added Easter Eggs within many of their products. Stemming from Google's cultural work ethics
                of Google employees being able to spend 20% of their time for personal interest in projects, the easter eggs became a popular way for
                google to showcase the developers creativity and humor. Most popular searches do not contain easter eggs as it might affect usability.
