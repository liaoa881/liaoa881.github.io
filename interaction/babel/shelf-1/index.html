          <p>Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. 
            He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language 
            was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative 
            analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the 
            fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, 
            the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two 
            identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations 
            of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, 
            the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of 
            those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary 
            on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
            <br>
            <br>
            When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. 
            All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose 
            eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited 
            dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated 
            for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy 
            abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. 
            These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the 
            deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. <span>Others went 
            mad...</span> The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but 
            the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be 
            computed as zero.
