        <p> it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. 
          It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; 
          it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. 
          All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter 
          how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value 
          of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague 
          thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in 
          which it was formulated by its originators.
