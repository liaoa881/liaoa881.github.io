          <p>The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or
             turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner,
              but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, 
              have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive 
              me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, 
              infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.

            I have just written the word <em>"infinite"</em>.' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit;
             I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate 
             that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd. Those who 
             imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this 
             solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an <span>eternal traveler</span> were to cross it in any direction, 
             after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: 
             the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4.

            The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. 
            The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two 
            letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)

            Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of 
            unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a 
            single librarian.

            I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can 
            be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose 
            structure corresponds to that of a ladder.

            <em>Letizia Alvarez de Toledo </em> has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, 
            a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing 
            an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid 
            bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silky vade mecum would not 
            be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.
