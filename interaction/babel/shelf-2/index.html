          <p>At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries - 
            <em>the origin of the Library and of time</em> - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries 
            could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have 
            produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted 
            the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they 
            always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the 
            librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. 
            Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.

            As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held
             precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that 
             the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of 
             chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood 
             I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and 
             feebly mimic the divine disorder.
