          <p>
            <span>Second</span>: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to 
            formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless 
            and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the 
            letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of 
            letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward 
            statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians 
            repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in 
            the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain 
            that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
